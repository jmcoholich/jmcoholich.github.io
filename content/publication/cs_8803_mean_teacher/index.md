abstract: 'We build off of the work of (Tarvainen et. al. 2017) and apply the mean-teacher approach to semi-supervised semantic segmentation. We propose sliding-window teacher evaluation and the ensembling of two mean-teachers with different update rates. Only the latter modification improved results over the baseline mean-teacher. See linked one-minute video for more details.
