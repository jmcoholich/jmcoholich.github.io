I am a [Robotics PhD](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics/phd-program-robotics) student at Georgia Tech, advised by [Dr. Zsolt Kira](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/zsolt-kira). My research involves XYZ.

As an undergrad, I did research with Luis Sentis and Gray. I also did three cool internships in undergrad and worked on the FSAE team. I worked on the SpaceX Dragon Capsule, Harmony Robot, and the Perserverance Rover.
