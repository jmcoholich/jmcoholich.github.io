## Here's what the challenge is


## Here's a screenshot of the finish

## Here are some concepts I had to use
- dynamic programming
- graph algorithms
- combinatorics
- Burnside's Lemma and Pólya enumeration theorem, group theory, permutation groups, orbits and stabilizers, group actions, Stirling numbers of the first kind, cycle indices

The last question was the hardest and involved (the above). I had to refresh myself on group theory and learn Burnside's lemma.


<!-- What were all the problems I had
level 1: Remove names that occur more than n times from a list
level 2: arranging plates to get numbers divisible by 3, some other DP stuff
level 3: triplets of divisible numbers (DP), the replicating bombs (discrete math, graphs?), number of possible staircases that can be built (DP)
level 4: laser gun bouncing (idk), the set cover ish thing (combinatorics) -->
