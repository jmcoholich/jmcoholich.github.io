My current research thrust is the application of reinforcement learning to robotics and legged locomotion. I am also interested in using learned priors to increase sample efficiency and decrease reward engineering required in reinforcement learning for real-world tasks.\nDuring my bachelor’s degree, I was an undergraduate research assistant in the Human Centered Robotics Lab where I had the pleasure of working with Dr. Luis Sentis and Dr. Gray Thomas. I spent my summers interning at SpaceX, Harmonic Bionics, and NASA JPL. Additionally, I spent a large amount of time co-founding and leading Longhorn Racing Electric.\nI also enjoy hiking, running, and rock climbing.\n","date":1653955200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1653955200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Update: I am currently looking for a summer internship related to my research interests.

It didn’t work and failed to obtain nearly any reward on most OpenAI Gym environments. It took a few more months of debugging, reading other RL implementations, and talking to colleagues to get things working. My conversations with other Georgia Tech students revealed that initially struggling to do basic things with RL was not uncommon. These blog posts do a great job of explaining the difficulty with RL and really resonate with my own experiences.\nIn hindsight, there was no single major flaw with my initial PPO implementation, but rather many small tricks and optimizations that were missing. The purpose of this post is to enumerate these tricks and provide references to code where they are implemented. They are roughly ordered in descending order of importance. Knowledge of some of these tricks is only necessary if you are implementing an RL algorithm from scratch, as most public implementations will already include them. However, knowing of their existence will enable you to debug more effectively and make changes more intelligently.\nDifferent RL implementations will include a slightly different set of tricks. As evidence of their importance, check out this figure (below) from the paper Deep Reinforcement Learning that Matters. The authors show empirically that different popular implementions of the same RL algorithm differ significantly in performance on standard RL benchmarks, even when controlling for hyperparameters and network architecture.\nFigure 6 from Deep Reinforcement Learning that Matters, plotting the performance of different RL implementations averaged over 5 random seeds. These variations can be explained by differences in implementation and different PyTorch/TF versions.\nNow for some disclaimers – nearly all of my experience comes from training on-policy algorithms for continuous control, so there may be useful tips for discrete/off-policy settings that I’m missing. Also, RL is a super-hot field and perhaps some of the content in this post is already outdated. Hopefully, this blog is at least useful to someone starting out like I was. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you think there is something important missing!\nMost of the examples will come from either of these two RL implementations:\npytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr-gail RL Games Implementing an RL algorithm from scratch is an excellent way to learn. However, if you just need to get something working quickly, you should instead just fork a popular repo and start from there. Here are some suggestions:\nStable Baselines3 RL Games pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr RLlib Contents:\nObservation and Normalization Clipping Dense Rewards Hyperparameter Tuning Gradient Normalization and Clipping Reward Normalization and Clipping Advantage Standardization Bootstrapping Incomplete Episodes Generalized Advantage Estimation Entropy Decay Value Network Loss Clipping Learning Rate Scheduling Thanks to Andrew Szot and Mathew Piotrowicz for reading drafts of this and providing feedback.\nObservation Normalization and Clipping In RL, the inputs to the policy and value networks are observations, which can consist of values that differ by orders of magnitude. For example, if you are learning a policy to control a robot, your observation could contain joint angles ranging from $ -\\frac{\\pi}{2} $ to $ \\frac{\\pi}{2} $ radians and a robot position coordinate that lies between 0 and 1000 meters. Normalizing the input space to eliminate this difference in scale leads to more stable training and faster convergence. This should be nothing new to those with prior experience training neural networks.\nThe two most common methods for preprocessing are standardization and rescaling. Standardization refers to subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the data so that each dimension approximates a standard normal distribution. Rescaling means mapping the data to the range $ \\left[0, 1\\right] $ by subtacting the min and dividing by the range. In either case, clipping should also be applied after normalization. Neural networks are bad at extrapolation, and outliers can produce unexpected outputs. In my work, observations are clipped to $[-5.0, 5.0]$ after standardization.\nIn supervised learning, statistics calculated over the training set are used to normalize each sample. In RL, this isn’t possible because the dataset (consisting of interactions with the environment) is collected online and the statistics change continuously. Because of this, you need to calculate an online mean and standard deviation. Most RL codebases use an implementation of Welford’s Online Algorithm like this one from Stable Baselines3.\nThis online approach is best when your algorithm needs to work on many different environments. However, it often causes an initial drop in …","date":1653955200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653955200,"objectID":"a720526db105fcb3d60fe9fbb213b85a","permalink":"https://jmcoholich.github.io/post/rl_bag_of_tricks/","publishdate":"2022-05-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/rl_bag_of_tricks/","section":"post","summary":"Update 9/15/2022: Experimental results coming soon!\nWhen I first started studying reinforcement learning (RL), I implemented Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from scratch using only the psuedocode on OpenAI’s website.
