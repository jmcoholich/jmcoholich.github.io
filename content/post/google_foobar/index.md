<!-- ## Here's what the challenge is -->

The Google Foobar challenge is a programming challenge used by Google for recruiting. You must be invited to participate ([article](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/google-foobar-googles-secret-hiring-process-bc92f011c6ad) with more info). The challenge contains five levels of increasing difficulty, which require knowlege in the following areas:
- dynamic programming
- graph theory
- combinatorics

 The final level was indeed the most challenging and required me to understand [permutation groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_group) and apply the [Pólya enumeration theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%B3lya_enumeration_theorem).


<!-- ## Here's a screenshot of the finish

## Here are some concepts I had to use -->

<!-- - Burnside's Lemma and Pólya enumeration theorem, group theory, permutation groups, orbits and stabilizers, group actions, Stirling numbers of the first kind, cycle indices -->

<!-- The last question was the hardest and involved (the above). I had to refresh myself on group theory and learn Burnside's lemma. -->


<!-- What were all the problems I had
level 1: Remove names that occur more than n times from a list
level 2: arranging plates to get numbers divisible by 3, some other DP stuff
level 3: triplets of divisible numbers (DP), the replicating bombs (discrete math, graphs?), number of possible staircases that can be built (DP)
level 4: laser gun bouncing (idk), the set cover ish thing (combinatorics) -->

Upon completion, I received a message encrypted in Base64, which translated to:

{'success' : 'great',\
'colleague' : 'esteemed',\
'efforts' : 'incredible',\
'achievement' : 'unlocked',\
'rabbits' : 'safe',\
'foo' : 'win!'}

I really enjoyed solving these problems -- thanks [Mathew](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathew-piotrowicz-aa4962137/) for the invite link!
